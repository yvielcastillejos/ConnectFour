# ConnectFour
In this repository, I will attempt to make an AI TicTacToe using the minimax algorithm. This serves as an easy review of the Minimax Algorithm.

## The Game:
- To run the game, launch ```pyplay.py```

### Level 1 with depth of 1
<img src="https://github.com/yvielcastillejos/ConnectFour/blob/master/L1.gif" height = "500" width = "500">

### Level 2 with depth of 2

<img src="https://github.com/yvielcastillejos/ConnectFour/blob/master/L2.gif" height = 500 width = 500>

### Level 3 with depth of 3

<img src="https://github.com/yvielcastillejos/ConnectFour/blob/master/L3.gif" height = 500 width = 500>
